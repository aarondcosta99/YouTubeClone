# YouTubeClone
YoutubeClone is an Android app that was developed to look similar to the actual YouTube app. This app fetches content from an API and displays it inside a recyclerview.

This app was developed on Android Studio in Kotlin and the database used was Google's Cloud Firestore. The [API](https://youtubecloneapinodejs.herokuapp.com/players) I created for this app.
